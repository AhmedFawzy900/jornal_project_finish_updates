              Peer review exists to ensure that journals publish good science
              which is of benefit to entire scientific community. Sometimes
              authors find the peer-review process intimidating because it can
              lead to the rejection of their manuscript. Keep in mind that
              revisions and improvement are part of the publication process and
              actually help raise the quality of your manuscript. Peer review is
              an integral part of scientific publishing that confirms the
              validity of the science reported. Peer reviewers are experts who
              volunteer their time to help improve the journal manuscripts they
              review&mdash;they offer authors free advice.

              Reviewers play a pivotal role in scholarly publishing. The
              importance of peer review system includes (1) validation academic
              work, (2) helping to improve the quality of published research,
              and (3) increasing network possibilities within research
              communities. Peer review comes in different types. Each system has
              its own advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;
              <strong>Double-blind review</strong>&nbsp;is preferred by our
              journal. In this system, both the reviewer and the author are
              anonymous. Some advantages of this model could be listed including
              (1) author anonymity limits reviewer bias, for example based on an
              author's gender, country of origin, academic status or previous
              publication history. (2) Articles written by prestigious or
              renowned authors are considered on the basis of the content of
              their papers, rather than their reputation.

              All submissions to the journal are initially reviewed the
              editorial office. At this stage, manuscripts may be rejected
              without peer review if it is felt that they are not relevant to
              the journal's scope or do not conform to manuscript formatting
              requirements. This fast rejection process means that authors are
              given a quick decision and do not need to wait for the review
              process.

              Manuscripts that pass initial screening will be forwarded to the
              appropriate section editor. The section editor may suggest
              rejection based on fatal design flaw, inappropriate replications,
              lack of novelty, or other major concerns. If appropriate, the
              paper will be sent out for peer review, usually to 2 independent
              reviewers who will provide comments. The section editor may
              recommend rejection or acceptance at this point, after which the
              manuscript and reviewer comments are made available to the
              editor-in-chief for a final decision to the authors. The
              manuscript will be sent back to the corresponding author for
              revision according to the guidelines of the reviewers. Authors
              have 6 weeks to complete the revision, which shall be returned to
              the section editor. Failure to return the manuscript within 6
              weeks will will lock the author out of re-submitting the revision.

              Rejected manuscripts can be resubmitted only with an invitation
              from the section editor or editor-in-chief. Revised versions of
              previously rejected manuscripts are treated as new submissions.
