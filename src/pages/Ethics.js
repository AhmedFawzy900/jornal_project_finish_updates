                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Reviewers should not share any
                information from an assigned manuscript with outsiders without the
                prior permission from the Editor or preserve the data from an
                assigned manuscript.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Competence:</strong> Reviewer with fair expertise should
                complete the review. Assigned Reviewer with inadequate expertise
                should feel responsible and may decline the review as it is
                presumed that reviewer will be an expert in the respective field.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Constructive assessment:</strong> Reviewer comments should
                appreciate positive aspects of the work, identify negative aspects
                constructively, and indicate the enhancement needed. A reviewer
                should explain and support his or her judgment clearly enough that
                Editors and Authors can understand the basis of the comments. The
                reviewer should ensure that an observation or argument that has
                been previously reported be accompanied by a relevant citation and
                should immediately alert the Editor when he or she becomes aware
                of duplicate publication. A reviewer should not use any kind of
                abusive language while commenting on an article. Judgment of each
                article should be done without any bias and personal interest by
                the assigned reviewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Impartiality and Integrity:</strong> Reviewer&rsquo;s
                decision should solely depend on scientific merit, relevance to
                the subject, scope of the journal rather than financial, racial,
                ethnic origin etc., of the authors.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Disclosure of conflict of interest:</strong> To the extent
                feasible, the reviewer should minimize the conflict of interest.
                In such situation, reviewer should notify the editor describing
                the conflict of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Timeliness and responsiveness: </strong>Reviewers should
                morally abide to provide the review comments within the stipulated
                time and be active enough in responding to the queries raised by
                the editor if any.

                <p>Responsibilities of Editor and Editorial Board</p>
                <p>
                Editors have a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the
                published literature, if required, by publishing errata or
                corrections identifying anything of significance, retractions, and
                expressions of concern as quickly as possible. Editor must comply
                with the policy guidelines provided by the publisher and fulfill

                end users very seriously. The journal place great importance on

                policy is based on the best practice followed in the academic

                <p>
                It is a general principle of scholarly communication that the
                Editor of a learned journal is solely and independently
                responsible for deciding which article(s) shall be published out
                of the submitted articles in a particular time. In making this
                decision, the Editor is guided by the policies of the journal's
                Editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements in
                force regarding copyright infringement and plagiarism. An outcome
                of this principle is the importance of the scholarly archive as a
                permanent, historic record of the transactions of scholarship.
                Articles that have been published shall remain extant, exact and
                unaltered as far as possible. However, occasionally unavoidable
                circumstances may arise where after publication the article
                requires retraction or even removal from a particular journal.
                Such actions must not be undertaken lightly and can only occur
                under exceptional circumstances, such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Article withdrawal:</strong> This is only used for
                &ldquo;Article in Press&rdquo; which represents the early versions
                of the accepted articles. If any article at the stage of
                &ldquo;Article in Press&rdquo;, by any means, represents
                infringements of professional ethical codes, such as multiple
                submissions, bogus claims of authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent
                use of data or similar incidences, the article may be withdrawn
                depending on the Editor&rsquo;s discretion. In this regard,
                Editor&rsquo;s decision must be considered as final following the
                deep assessment and analysis of the situations, on a case by case
                basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Article retraction:</strong> Infringements of professional
                ethical codes, such as multiple submissions, sham claims of
                authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent use of data and similar claims
                will lead to the retraction of an article. Occasionally, a
                retraction may be considered to correct errors in submission or
                publication.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Article removal and replacement:</strong> Subjected to
                legal limitations of the publisher, copyright holder or author(s).
                Identification of false or inaccurate data representation which
                may pose a serious health risk and involves any means of
                scientific data tampering or other fraud hindering fair practice

                Take steps to reduce covert redundant publication, e.g., by
                requiring all clinical trials to be registered. Ensure that
                published material is securely archived. Have systems in place to
                give authors the opportunity to make original research articles
                freely available.

                <strong>Ethics</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The publication of an article in a peer-reviewed journal is an
                essential building block in the development of a coherent and
                respected network of knowledge. It is a direct reflection of the
                quality of work of the author and the institutions that support
                them. Peer-reviewed articles support and embody the scientific
                method. It is therefore important to agree upon standards of
                expected ethical behavior.

                <p>Ethics topics to consider when publishing:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                    <strong>Authorship of the paper:</strong> Authorship should be
                    limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the
                    conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported
                    study.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Originality and plagiarism:</strong> The authors should
                    ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if
                    the authors have used the work and/or words of others, that this
                    has been appropriately cited or quoted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data access and retention:</strong> Authors may be asked
                    to provide the raw data in connection with a paper for editorial
                    review, and should be prepared to provide public access to such
                    data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication:</strong>{" "}
                    An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing
                    essentially the same research in more than one journal or
                    primary publication. NIDOC does not view the following uses of a
                    work as prior publication: publication in the form of an
                    abstract; publication as an academic thesis; publication as an
                    electronic preprint. Information on prior publication is
                    included within each NIDOC journal&rsquo;s Guide for Authors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acknowledgement of sources:</strong> Proper
                    acknowledgment.

                <li>
                    <strong>Disclosure and conflicts of interest:</strong> All
                    submissions must include disclosure of all relationships that
                    could be viewed as presenting a potential conflict of interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fundamental errors in published works:</strong> When an
                    author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her
                    own published work, it is the author's obligation to promptly
                    notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the
                    editor to retract or correct the paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reporting standards:</strong> Authors of reports of
                    original research should present an accurate account of the work
                    performed as well as an objective discussion of its
                    significance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hazards and human or animal subjects:</strong>{" "}
                    Statements of compliance are required if the work involves
                    chemicals, procedures or equipment that have any unusual hazards
                    inherent in their use, or if it involves the use of animal or
                    human subjects.

                    <strong>Use of patient images or case details:</strong> Studies
                    on patients or volunteers require ethics committee approval and
                    informed consent, which should be documented in the paper.
